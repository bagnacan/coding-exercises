# Given an array A of n integers, a rotation of A is defined as a shift of each
# element to the right by one index (with the last element moved to the first
# place). Example, the rotation of A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7].
#
# Write a function:
#  def solution(A, k)
#
# ...that, given an array A of n integers and an integer k, returns the array A
# rotated k times, i.e., each element of A is shifted k times to the right.
# Examples:
# - with A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6], k = 3
#     the function returns [9, 7, 6, 3, 8].
# - with A = [0, 0, 0], k = 1
#     the function returns [0, 0, 0]
# - with A = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 4
#     the function returns [1, 2, 3, 4]
#
# Assume that:
# - n and k are integers within the range [0..100]
# - each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000]

def solution(A, k):

    n = len(A)

    if k >= n:  # avoid performing complete rotations
        k %= n

    # pop elements from A starting at the (n-k)-th position and append them to
    # B. When the elements are over, pop elements from A starting at the 0-th
    # position. When also these elements are over, B contains the k-th rotation
    # of A.
    # When A decreases, B increases and increases.
    B = []
    idx = n - k

    # pop each value of A from the k-th position onward (until A has elements)
    while idx < len(A):
        B.append(A.pop(idx))

    # pop each value of A from the 0-th position onward (until A has elements)
    while len(A) > 0:
        B.append(A.pop(0))

    return B


A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6]
k = 3
print(f'A: {A} before {k} rotation(s)')

cyclic_rotation = solution(A, k)

print(f'A: {cyclic_rotation} after {k} rotation(s)')
